      <description>This practical simulates the early assessment and reconstruction of an Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak. It covers various aspects of analysis of the early stage of an outbreak, including contact tracing data, epicurves, growth rate estimation from log-linear models, and more refined estimates of transmissibility. A follow-up practical will provide an introduction to transmission chain reconstruction using outbreaker2.
