<p>This practical is the second part of the response to a simulated Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak taking place in the city of Ankh, Republic of Morporkia. While the <a href="../simulated-evd-early">first part</a> focussed on early assessments of transmissibility, this part explores more methodological options for estimating transmissibility, and provides an introduction to outbreak reconstruction using <em>outbreaker2</em>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="an-update-on-the-evd-outbreak-in-ankh-republic-of-morporkia" class="section level1">
<h1>An update on the EVD outbreak in Ankh, Republic of Morporkia</h1>
<p>After some rather concerning <a href="../simulated-evd-early">preliminary results</a> on the new EVD outbreak in the city of Ankh, Republic of Morporkia, Public Health Morporkia (PHM) has sent you updates of the linelists and contact data. This time, PHM has also obtained Whole Genome Sequences (WGS) of the Ebola virus isolated in patients. As before, you are asked to assess the situation and produce evidence-based recommendations for informing the response.</p>
<div id="required-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Required packages</h2>
<p>The following packages, available on CRAN, are needed for this practical:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/index.html"><code>readxl</code></a> to read <code>.xlsx</code> files</li>
<li><a href="http://ggplot2.org/"><code>ggplot2</code></a> for graphics</li>
<li><a href="http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/incidence/"><code>incidence</code></a> for epicurves</li>
<li><a href="http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epicontacts/"><code>epicontacts</code></a> for contact data visualisation</li>
<li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiEstim/index.html"><code>EpiEstim</code></a> for time-varying reproduction number estimation</li>
<li><a href="http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/distcrete"><code>distcrete</code></a> to obtain discrete time delay distributions</li>
<li><a href="http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epitrix"><code>epitrix</code></a> for some practical tricks for epidemics analysis</li>
<li><a href="http://ape-package.ird.fr/"><code>ape</code></a> for DNA sequence analysis</li>
<li><a href="http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/outbreaker2"><code>outbreaker2</code></a> to reconstruct the outbreak</li>
</ul>
<p>To install these packages, use <code>install.packages</code>, e.g.:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;readxl&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;incidence&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;epicontacts&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;EpiEstim&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;distcrete&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;epitrix&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;ape&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;outbreaker2&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="the-new-data" class="section level2">
<h2>The new data</h2>
<p>The data update includes new linelists and contact lists:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="../../data/PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-11-25.xlsx">PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-11-25.xlsx</a>: a linelist containing case information up to the 25th November 2017</p></li>
<li><p><a href="../../data/PHM-EVD-contacts-2017-11-25.xlsx">PHM-EVD-contacts-2017-11-25.xlsx</a>: a list of contacts reported between cases up to the 25th November, where <code>from</code> indicates a potential source of infection, and <code>to</code> the recipient of the contact.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To read into R, download these files and use the function <code>read_xlsx()</code> from the <code>readxl</code> package to import the data. Each import will create a data table stored as a <code>tibble</code> object. Call the first one <code>linelist</code>, and the second one <code>contacts</code>. For instance, your first command line could look like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>linelist &lt;- readxl::read_xlsx(&quot;PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-11-25.xlsx&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Note that for further analyses, you will need to make sure all dates are stored as <code>Date</code> objects. This can be done using <code>as.Date</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>linelist$onset &lt;- as.Date(linelist$onset)</code></pre>
<p>Once imported, the data should look like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## linelist: one line per case

<h1>Analysis of epidemiological data</h1>
<div id="visualising-contact-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Visualising contact data</h2>
<p>After the initial stage of the outbreak, contact tracing has been maintained but started being sparser, and exposures haven’t been reported for all cases. Despite these limitations, contacts are still a valuable source of information. Using the function <code>make_epicontacts</code> in the <code>epicontacts</code> package, create a new <code>epicontacts</code> object called <code>x</code>, specifying that contacts are directed. When plotting the data, use the arguments <code>node_shape</code> and <code>shapes</code> (see <code>?vis_epicontacts</code>) to distinguish males and females. For a list of available symbols and corresponding shape code, you can type <code>epicontacts::codeawesome</code>.</p>
<p>The results should look like:</p>
<pre><code>##

<p>This phylogenetic tree shows the inferred evolution of the pathogen sequences. Branch length (x-axis) correspond to the number of mutations occuring between lineages (indicated by the axis at the bottom). The tree has been rooted to the index case, so that this sequence (top, left) is the “most ancient” part of the tree. Note that in such representations, distances on the y-axis are meaningless.</p>
<p><font class="question">How would you interpret this phylogenetic tree? Many methods of outbreak reconstruction infer transmission events from phylogenies. What results would you expect here?</font></p>

<div id="building-delay-distributions" class="section level2">
<h2>Building delay distributions</h2>
<p><code>outbreaker2</code> can handle different types of dates. When dates of onset are provided, information on the <em>generation time</em> (delay between primary and secondary infections) and on the <em>incubation period</em> (delay between infection and symptom onset) can be included in the model. These delays are typically modelled as Gamma distributions, which need to be discretised in order to account for the fact that time is reported as days.</p>
<p>A possible approach here would be using estimates of the <em>mean</em> and <em>standard deviation</em> of the incubation period and the generation time published in the literature. From this, one would need to use <code>epitrix</code> to convert these parameters into <em>shape</em> and <em>scale</em> for a Gamma distribution, and then use <code>distcrete</code> to generate discretised distributions.</p>
<p>Alternatively, these parameters can be estimated from a previous, reasonably similar outbreak. PHM asks you to use the dataset <code>ebola_sim_clean</code> from the <code>outbreaks</code> package to this end. Start by extracting data on the inbucation period (i.e. delay from infection to onset) and store the output in an object called <code>incub</code>; results should look like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>incub &lt;- with(ebola_sim_clean$linelist, date_of_onset - date_of_infection)
incub &lt;- as.integer(na.omit(incub))

<p><img src="/post/practical-ebola-reconstruction_files/figure-html/incubation-1.png" width="672" /></p>

<h2>Using the original <code>outbreaker</code> model</h2>
<p>The original <code>outbreaker</code> model combined temporal information (here, dates of onset) with sequence data to infer who infected whom. Here, we use <code>outbreaker2</code> to apply this model to the data.</p>
<p>All inputs to the new <code>outbreaker</code> function are prepared using dedicated functions, which make a number of checks on provided inputs and define defaults:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(outbreaker2)

data &lt;- outbreaker_data(dates = linelist$onset, # dates of onset
                        dna = unname(dna), # WGS; remove labels for compatibility
                        w_dens = gen_time_dist$d(1:100), # generation time distribution
                        f_dens = incub_dist$d(1:100) # incubation period distribution
                        )</code></pre>
<p>We also create a configuration, which determines different aspects of the analysis, including which parameters need to be estimated, initial values of parameters, the length of the MCMC, etc.:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>config &lt;- create_config(move_kappa = FALSE, # don&#39;t look for missing cases
                        move_pi = FALSE, # don&#39;t estimate reporting
                        init_pi = 1, # set reporting to 1
                        find_import = FALSE, # don&#39;t look for additional imported cases
                        init_tree = &quot;star&quot; # star-like tree as starting point
                        )</code></pre>
<p>We can now run the analysis. This should take a couple of minutes on modern laptops. Note the use of <code>set.seed(0)</code> to have identical results across different users and computers:</p>

<p>As a point of comparison, repeat the same analysis using temporal data only, and plot a graph of ancestries (<code>type = &quot;alpha&quot;</code>); you should obtain something along the lines of:</p>

<h2>Adding contact data to the reconstruction process</h2>
<p>Contact data currently contains case labels. While <code>epicontacts</code> objects will soon be accepted as inputs in <code>outbreaker2</code>, for now we need to operate some minor transformations to define contacts using cases indices rather than labels:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ctd &lt;- matrix(match(unlist(x$contacts), linelist$case_id), ncol = 2)
head(ctd)
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    6   28
## [2,]    1   15
## [3,]   30   46
## [4,]    4   23
## [5,]    4   13
## [6,]   41   43
dim(ctd)
## [1] 36  2</code></pre>
<p>All inputs to the <code>outbreaker</code> function are prepared using dedicated functions, which make a number of checks on provided inputs and define defaults:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data &lt;- outbreaker_data(dates = linelist$onset, # dates of onset
                        dna = unname(dna), # dna sequences
                        ctd = ctd, # contact data
                        w_dens = gen_time_dist$d(1:100), # generation time distribution
                        f_dens = incub_dist$d(1:100) # incubation period distribution
                        )</code></pre>
<p>We are now ready to run the analysis. This may take a couple of minutes, depending on your computer:</p>
