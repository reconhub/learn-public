  title    = "Ebola virus disease in West Africa--the first 9 months of the
              epidemic and forward projections",
  author   = "{WHO Ebola Response Team}",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: On March 23, 2014, the World Health Organization
              (WHO) was notified of an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in
              Guinea. On August 8, the WHO declared the epidemic to be a
              ``public health emergency of international concern.'' METHODS: By
              September 14, 2014, a total of 4507 probable and confirmed cases,
              including 2296 deaths from EVD (Zaire species) had been reported
              from five countries in West Africa--Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria,
              Senegal, and Sierra Leone. We analyzed a detailed subset of data
              on 3343 confirmed and 667 probable Ebola cases collected in
              Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone as of September 14.
              RESULTS: The majority of patients are 15 to 44 years of age
              (49.9\% male), and we estimate that the case fatality rate is
              70.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 69 to 73) among persons
              with known clinical outcome of infection. The course of
              infection, including signs and symptoms, incubation period (11.4
              days), and serial interval (15.3 days), is similar to that
              reported in previous outbreaks of EVD. On the basis of the
              initial periods of exponential growth, the estimated basic
              reproduction numbers (R0 ) are 1.71 (95\% CI, 1.44 to 2.01) for
              Guinea, 1.83 (95\% CI, 1.72 to 1.94) for Liberia, and 2.02 (95\%
              CI, 1.79 to 2.26) for Sierra Leone. The estimated current
              reproduction numbers (R) are 1.81 (95\% CI, 1.60 to 2.03) for
              Guinea, 1.51 (95\% CI, 1.41 to 1.60) for Liberia, and 1.38 (95\%
              CI, 1.27 to 1.51) for Sierra Leone; the corresponding doubling
              times are 15.7 days (95\% CI, 12.9 to 20.3) for Guinea, 23.6 days
              (95\% CI, 20.2 to 28.2) for Liberia, and 30.2 days (95\% CI, 23.6
              to 42.3) for Sierra Leone. Assuming no change in the control
              measures for this epidemic, by November 2, 2014, the cumulative
              reported numbers of confirmed and probable cases are predicted to
              be 5740 in Guinea, 9890 in Liberia, and 5000 in Sierra Leone,
              exceeding 20,000 in total. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that
              without drastic improvements in control measures, the numbers of
              cases of and deaths from EVD are expected to continue increasing
              from hundreds to thousands per week in the coming months.",

  abstract    = "Recent years have seen progress in the development of
                 statistically rigorous frameworks to infer outbreak
                 transmission trees (``who infected whom'') from
                 epidemiological and genetic data. Making use of pathogen
                 genome sequences in such analyses remains a challenge,
                 however, with a variety of heuristic approaches having been
                 explored to date. We introduce a statistical method exploiting
                 both pathogen sequences and collection dates to unravel the
                 dynamics of densely sampled outbreaks. Our approach identifies
                 likely transmission events and infers dates of infections,
                 unobserved cases and separate introductions of the disease. It
                 also proves useful for inferring numbers of secondary
                 infections and identifying heterogeneous infectivity and
                 super-spreaders. After testing our approach using simulations,
                 we illustrate the method with the analysis of the beginning of
                 the 2003 Singaporean outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory
                 Syndrome (SARS), providing new insights into the early stage
                 of this epidemic. Our approach is the first tool for disease
                 outbreak reconstruction from genetic data widely available as
                 free software, the R package outbreaker. It is applicable to
                 various densely sampled epidemics, and improves previous
                 approaches by detecting unobserved and imported cases, as well
                 as allowing multiple introductions of the pathogen. Because of
                 its generality, we believe this method will become a tool of
                 choice for the analysis of densely sampled disease outbreaks,
                 and will form a rigorous framework for subsequent
                 methodological developments.",

              reproduction numbers during epidemics",

  abstract = "The quantification of transmissibility during epidemics is
              essential to designing and adjusting public health responses.
              Transmissibility can be measured by the reproduction number R,
              the average number of secondary cases caused by an infected
              individual. Several methods have been proposed to estimate R over
              the course of an epidemic; however, they are usually difficult to
              implement for people without a strong background in statistical
              modeling. Here, we present a ready-to-use tool for estimating R
              from incidence time series, which is implemented in popular
              software including Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation,
              Redmond, Washington). This tool produces novel, statistically
              robust analytical estimates of R and incorporates uncertainty in
              the distribution of the serial interval (the time between the
              onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of symptoms in
              secondary cases). We applied the method to 5 historical
              outbreaks; the resulting estimates of R are consistent with those
              presented in the literature. This tool should help
              epidemiologists quantify temporal changes in the transmission
              intensity of future epidemics by using surveillance data.",
