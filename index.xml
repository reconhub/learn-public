      <description>This case study simulates the early assessment and reconstruction of an Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak. It covers various aspects of analysis of the early stage of an outbreak, and provides an introduction to transmission chain reconstruction using outbreaker2.

Installing required packages The following packages, available on CRAN, are needed for this case study:
 xlsx to read .xlsx files incidence for epicurves epicontacts for contact data visualisation  To install these packages, use install.</description>

      <description>Beyond the availability of data and methods, reproducible science requires the traceability of analyses. Whether it is for yourself or for collaborators, as series of tools and good practices can facilitate your work flow, simplify analyses, and prevent the loss of data and results. This lecture provides an introduction to reproducibility using .

      <title>Phylogenetic tree reconstruction</title>

      <description>This practical aims to illustrate the basics of phylogenetic reconstruction using R, with an emphasis on how the methods work, how their results can be interpreted, and the relative advantages and limitations of the methods. Three main classes of phylogenetic approaches are introduced, namely distance-based, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods. We also illustrate how to assess the reliability of individual nodes using bootstrap, and show how a simple linear model can be used to estimate a molecular clock in rooted phylogenies.</description>
